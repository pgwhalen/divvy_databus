============

This is pretty ugly and over-complicated, but I wanted to get some Spring/Hibernate experience in.  It's a simple process that runs a load-to-postgres job every minute.  If left alone, it'll generate enough data to make you wonder if you really should be paying Amazon this much to host a side-project.
